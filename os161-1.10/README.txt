### Reading Code Section

- `kern/main/main.c`: This is the main entry point of OS/161. It performs the **initial kernel boot sequence**, initializes core components like the console, thread scheduler, and virtual memory system. It also prints the OS version and build information.
  
- `kern/syscall/syscall.c`: Handles **system call execution**. When a user program makes a system call (e.g., `sys_read`), this file **validates arguments and routes execution** to the appropriate kernel function.

- `kern/thread/thread.c`: Manages **threads and process scheduling**. It provides functionality for creating, running, and terminating threads within OS/161.

### System Call Execution Process:
1. **User program makes a system call** (e.g., `sys_open`).
2. **Control goes to `syscall.c`**, which **validates input and checks permissions**.
3. **If valid, `syscall.c` routes execution to a lower-level function**, such as `vfs_open()` in the virtual file system.
4. **The kernel executes the requested operation** and **returns control to the user program**.

This analysis is based on reviewing OS/161 source code.
